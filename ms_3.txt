line levels off at lower than [[45 \\text{cm}^3]]gas [1] <END_OF_PART>
<START_OF_PART> (b)(i) rate of reaction increases AND one or both of: <br \>
more particles exposed on surface / more (magnesium) particles per unit area / more particles per cm2 [1] <br \>
collision frequency increases / collision rate increases / more collisions per second [1] <br \>  <END_OF_PART>

particles move more slowly / particles have less kinetic energy [1] <br \>
fewer particles have activation energy (or above) / collisions are less successful [1] <END_OF_PART>
