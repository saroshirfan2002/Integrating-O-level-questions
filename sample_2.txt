<START_OF_PART>(ii) Name the catalyst used in the Contact process. [1]<END_OF_PART>
<START_OF_PART>(b) The electrolysis of dilute sulfuric acid using inert electrodes produces oxygen at the anode.<br />
(i) Define the term electrolysis. [2]<END_OF_PART>
<START_OF_PART>(ii) Construct the equation for the reaction taking place at the cathode. [1]<END_OF_PART>
<START_OF_PART>(c) Dilute sulfuric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide.<br />
[[\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4 + 2\\text{NaOH} \\rightarrow \\text{Na}_2\\text{SO}_4 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}]]<br />
