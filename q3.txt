<START_OF_QUESTION>Magnesium ribbon reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid. <br \>
[[\\text{Mg(s)} + 2\\text{HCl(aq)} \\rightarrow \\text{MgCl}{2}\\text{(aq)} +\\text{H}{2}\\text{(g)}]]
<START_OF_PART>(a) The graph shows the volume of hydrogen gas produced at 20 Â°C as the reaction proceeds. <br \>
The magnesium is in excess. <br \>
<INSERT_DIAGRAM>
The experiment is repeated using a lower concentration of hydrochloric acid. <br \>
The volume of acid used and all other conditions are the same. <br \>
Draw a line on the grid to show how the volume of hydrogen gas produced changes with <br \>
time when the reaction is done with a lower concentration of hydrochloric acid. [2]<END_OF_PART>
<START_OF_PART>(b)(i) Describe and explain, using ideas about collisions between particles, how the rate of the <br \>
reaction changes when magnesium powder is used instead of magnesium ribbon.<br \>
All other conditions are the same.[2]<END_OF_PART>
<START_OF_PART>(ii) Describe and explain, using ideas about collisions between particles, how the rate of the <br \>
reaction changes when the temperature of the reaction mixture is decreased. <br \>
All other conditions are the same.[2]<END_OF_PART>
<START_OF_PART>(c) Calculate the maximum volume, in dm3, of hydrogen formed when 1.68 g of magnesium react<br \>
 with excess dilute hydrochloric acid at room temperature and pressure.<br \>
Give your answer to three significant figures.[2]<END_OF_PART>
<START_OF_PART>(d) Magnesium is a good reducing agent.<br \>
Describe a test for reducing agents.<br \>
